          <p>Hi, I am Suchita Verma.
          <br>A budding Web Developer by profession and a Fine Artist by heart.
        <br>I love making sketches, paintings and putting my thoughts & ideas on to a paper.
        <br> My all the artworks you see on this page or on my instagram has been made by putting all my heart and passion into it.
      <br>I also delivered many customizable paid portrait sketches to the people out there, which they so loved it. If you want to have one, you can contact me either by sending a mail or by sending a dm on my instagram.
    <br>I did not done any degree or coursework for learning arts, it's just what I loved doing as my passion.
   <br>Currently, I am pursuing Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and yes I am into tech field. But this also motivate me to put and improve and make people know my work through the tech stack of mine.
  <br>So, I thought to build a art portfolio by using all my skills of web.
<br> I hope you like and love it. I'll be more than happier if you send your thought or a feedback by replying me on any of the ways.
